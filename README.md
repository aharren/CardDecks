## Overview

Card Decks is a small open source application for iPhone OS / iOS devices which
provides simple, configurable, colored, multi-line text cards which are grouped
into card decks.

A card deck can be used to show your vote or estimation on a certain topic in a
meeting, e.g. in a planning meeting used in agile software development methods
like Scrum or Extreme Programming. Or, if you are the chair of a session on a
conference, you can use a card deck to remind a speaker of the remaining time
for the presentation. Or, just use your cards to show your opinion, argument,
or mood, in a simple, non-verbal way. Or, if you are a teacher, use the shuffle
feature to randomly select a task from a card deck with tasks, or randomly
assign tasks to students.

The application contains some predefined card decks with voting cards, simple
colored cards, cards with numbers, colored cards which show remaining minutes,
etc. Individual card decks can be created with the built-in editor.

The application supports sending and receiving card decks via URLs, e.g. for
sharing your card decks with your friends or colleagues by e-mail.
