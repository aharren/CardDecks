## Overview

Card Decks is a small utility application for your iPhone/iPod touch and iPad
which brings you simple, configurable, colored, multi-line text cards that are
grouped into card decks.

A card deck can be used to show your vote or estimation on a certain topic in a
meeting, e.g. in a planning meeting used in agile software development methods
like Scrum or Extreme Programming. If the pre-configured cards don't fit your
needs, just extend the existing cards or build your own set of cards, e.g.
including special estimation numbers like "Pi" or "?". Or, if you are the chair
of a session on a conference, you can use a card deck to remind a speaker of the
remaining time for the presentation. Or, just use your cards to show your opinion,
argument, or mood, in a simple, non-verbal way. Or, use the shuffle feature to
randomly select a task from a card deck with tasks, or randomly assign tasks to
students, team members, etc.

Card Decks contains some pre-configured card decks with voting cards, simple
colored cards, cards with numbers, colored cards which show remaining minutes,
etc.

Individual card decks can be created with the built-in editor.

Each card in a card deck can be configured with a display time. This way, you
can build your own countdown timer with individual numbers, texts, reminders,
etc. Example timers for 15 and 60 minutes are pre-configured.

Additionally, Card Decks supports sending and receiving card decks via e-mail,
Twitter, AirDrop, etc. for sharing your card decks with your friends or colleagues.
